I remember January 1st, 2023. It was the coldest day yet in Riyadh and we were heading to school. All the students were fast asleep in the bus and dreaded the moment when the bus would reach school. Fast forward 12 months, I have completed an 1Ô∏è‚É£ / 8Ô∏è‚É£ of my degree.

2023 was a tough one, but I feel I came out stronger than ever. I am glad to say that I *think* I have completed all the goals I set for 2023.

Without further a do, let's go through the goals I have set for this year.

## Complete at least 12 courses in university

With two study terms and a work term in the following year, I hope to take at least 12 courses throughout those terms.

As of now, I have two choices:

1. 5 courses per study term and 2 courses in the work term
2. 6 courses per study term

The first option is better in terms of comfort, since each term has an easy number of courses. However, it is cost-inefficient, since I will have to pay almost *$1800 more*.

The second option is much more cose-efficient but at the cost of a medium but still doable number of courses.

My aim is to try and complete at least 5 courses during the work terms to gain an advantage in upcoming work terms and potentially reduce the degree duration.

## Get a good coop job

After reading a countless number of Reddit posts on finding the first coop job, I realised it is __TOUGH__.

Although I have quite a bit of experience in programming, particularly in __web development__ and some experience with __data-related__ programs and __machine learning__, I am not sure if it is enough for the competitiveness of coop search.

## Learn C++ and R

Although I learn C++ and R in future courses, I do wish to start a bit earlier and get my feet wet.

I think getting a good grasp of C++ will really help learning other languages and will broaden the jobs I can apply to.

R is the language of choice for most of the STAT and ECON courses I have next year. Even though R has become the Doc Hudson of data science, I think it is still worth learning for a much more hands-on and fundamental experience with data science.

## Learn machine learning

As of now, I am starting to really understand machine learning, learning about things like *regression*, *classification*, *neural networks* and *model optimisation*.

However, I do wish to continue learning machine learning and the the processes associated with building a good model, such as *data engineering*, *data analytics* and *cloud computing*.

The latter of the 3 is one which I feel will really elevate my skills. I might do the [AWS Machine Learning Speciality Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty/) since I have experience with AWS.

## Pay for my own flight tickets

This is my motivation to start making some money. If I don't make enough money to pay for flights tickets from Toronto to Riyadh, then *I am not coming for that holiday*.

I have explored quite a few options and will try them out and will hope for best. Here are some options I am going to try out:

1. Online tutoring üßë‚Äçüè´
2. Blogging and AdSense ‚úçÔ∏è
3. Medium Partner Program üìÉ

## Win a cup in intramural cricket

This is sort of random, since I just want to continue playing sports. However, since intramural cricket at university is a large tournament, I do wish to win the finals at the University of Waterloo cricket club.


And so, those are my goals for 2024. It is a short list but I most goals are quite broad. 

I might update this list in the future but will try not to change too much. Otherwise, I will see you at the end of the coming year üóìÔ∏è.
