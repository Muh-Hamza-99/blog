It was just 3 months ago since I first stepped on Canadian soil. Now, I have finished my first term, gotten my grades and am writing this post while I sip a hot cup of chai â˜• from Riyadh.

I had never had to put so much effort into studying. It wasn't too bad though, and it was rewarding and enjoyable. Am I excited to go back? Yes. I think the best mindset for university is to do your best for the next 12 weeks.

## Courses

I took 5 courses this term. I will talk about them in order of difficulty, with the first course being the most difficult. That being said, all the courses this term weren't insanely difficult.

### MATH 135 - Algebra

*This course was the perfect example of how university math is different from high school math.*

This course mostly revolved around proofs and proving statements. There were also some topics on basic number theory, modular arithmetic, complex numbers and polynomials.

I had two weekly assignments, two tests and a final. All the assessments were alright, with the tests and final being quite straightforward with a few tricky questions.

### CS 135 - Designing Functional Programs

*If only Racket wasn't the programming language used in this course.*

This course was difficult mainly because of the assignments. They were long and would have questions which would take me a solid half an hour to understand before starting to write any code.

The course content was nothing too tough, with most of the course teaching fundamental computer science concepts such as structures, recursion, trees and graphs.

We had weekly assignments, a midterm and a final. As mentioned the assignments were what gave this course a 2nd place; the midterm and final were much easier.

### MATH 137 - Calculus I

*Trust me, just survive the first half.*

As the wise person mentioned above, the first half is a slap to the face. The post-midterm content is basically a review of high school calculus.

The first half covers limits of sequences and functions. This half is very proof-heavy and requires much more intuition. The second half covers derivatives, the mean value theorem and taylor polynomials, which are more calculation-based.

We had weekly quizzes, a midterm and a final. The quizzes weren't too bad - except for 40% of a quiz being decided by 5 MCQs. The midterm and final were more balanced and weren't that hard.

### ECON 101 - Microeconomics

*Yes, it is a bird course, but the most boring one.*

This course was essentially a recap of IGCSE Economics. On the surface, we talked about the basic principles of economics and demand and supply. The rest of the course elaborated on demand and supply. 

We had three assignments, two tests and a final. The assignments were a guaranteed 100%, because of the following grading system:

| Assignment                          | Grade |
|-------------------------------------|-------|
| Nothing submitted                   | 0%    |
| Submitted but wrote bullsh*t        | 50%   |
| Submitted and didn't write bullsh*t | 100%  |

The two tests and final only consisted of MCQs and were really easy.

### ENGL 109 - Academic Writing

*Although it was the easiet, it was my lowest grade.*

I only took this course since I was interested in writing short stories. Even though there were times when I had no clue why we were told to write certain articles, I still had fun and enjoyed the course.

We had three major assignments, in-class assignments and final project. The three major assignments were easy but took some time to get a good final essay. The in-class assignments were a piece of cake and the final project was nothing too difficult.

## Outside Studies

As a keen freshmen in university, I was trying out everything that came in my way. Even though I think I did a bit too much, I don't regret it at all.

I feel that doing extracurriculars really help you better manage your time and prevent you from getting burnt out.

I joined the __CSC (Computer Science Club)__ as a web developer working on the Class of 2024 website. I also attended the two events held by the __PSA (Pakistan Student Association)__, which were amazing. I was even recorded at both events and went 'viral' ðŸ˜‚.

As for sports, I played __intramural squash__ and joined the __Cricket Club__.

## Takeaways

1. Your grades will drop, but don't get too bummed about it
2. Don't only study, but don't only not study as well
3. Start assignments early and mark all the due dates on an app like Notion
4. Export your calendar from the OPortal to Google Calendar rather than relying on a pixelated picture of the schedule
5. If in Village 1, the Crispy Chicken Wrap and cookies are amazing, and the buffet options are usually horrible
